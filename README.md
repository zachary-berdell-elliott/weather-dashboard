## Project Features

### Search 
The user of the website can enter text into the search bar then click the button to fetch data for the city. They will be alerted with an error message if the input is not a recognized city. 

### Weather Presentation
The user is presented with the current date and current weather at the top. The user can see the temperature, wind, humdity, weather icon, and UV Index. Below that the user is presented with a five day forecast that includes the same minus the UV index.

### City Search Saving
The users input will be saved to local storage after they search for a city. A button is added that can be removed when the user clicks the 'X' next to it.
